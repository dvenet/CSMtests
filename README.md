# CSMtests

Suite of tests for central statistical monitoring. CSMtests is an R package that can be installed as any R package.

The idea is to compare centers in a multicentric clinical trial to identify centers with outlying distributions,
across many different data types.

At the moment only contains tests on bivariate correlations, as in Desmedt et al, submitted.
